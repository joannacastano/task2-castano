Jenkins Task
Task 2: Install and Use a Plugin

Go to the Jenkins dashboard.

Click on "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins."

Install a plugin of your choice. (e.g., "GitHub Integration," "Docker," or any other plugin that interests you).

Configure the plugin according to your needs.

Create a job that uses the installed plugin. For example, if you installed the GitHub Integration plugin, create a job that triggers builds on code commits.

Save the project ( ex. task2-lastname ).

Provide a screenshot and the build url.
